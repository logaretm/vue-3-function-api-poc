### DON'T USE THIS IN PRODUCTION

This is an implementation of the [new function API](https://github.com/vuejs/rfcs/pull/42) using Vue.js 2.x. This is just a toy-project to test out ideas for Vue 3.x with the function API.

### Implemented API

The stuff I managed to hack my way to:

- `value`
- `computed`
- `watch`
- `onMounted`
- `onCreated`
- `createElement`
- `setup` function API.

This implementation is not complete and will probably break.
